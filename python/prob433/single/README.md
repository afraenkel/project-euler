# Computing the sum of the number of steps in Euclids Algorithm over the integer lattice.

The diagram below illustrates how the sum is computed.
* The yellow coordinates are the ones for which Euclid's algorithm
must be computed.
* The other colors show where identical steps appear. They propogate
vertically and diagonally.
* The top vertex is the coordinate (2,1)
